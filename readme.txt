🚀 Getting Started
🔧 Requirements
Install dependencies using conda or pip:

bash
Copy
pip install torch torchvision
pip install ftfy regex tqdm
pip install git+https://github.com/openai/CLIP.git
pip install matplotlib scikit-learn pandas
Ensure access to a CUDA-enabled GPU for training.

🏋️‍♀️ How to Run
Data Preprocessing:

Run explore_data_and_preprocess.ipynb
➤ Cleans reports, filters redacted entries, validates images.

Split Data:

splitting_data.ipynb
➤ Generates train, val, and test folders.

Zero-Shot CLIP:

baseline_model.ipynb
➤ Tests pretrained CLIP on chest X-rays without fine-tuning.

Fine-Tuning CLIP:

sampletestCLIP.ipynb
➤ Loads CLIPChestXrayDataset, trains with contrastive loss, and saves the model.

t-SNE Visualization:

data_visualization.ipynb
➤ Generates 2D plot of learned image features (normal vs. abnormal).

Manual Inspection:

manual_predictions_vs_groundtruth.txt
➤ Shows example predictions from test set for visual validation.
